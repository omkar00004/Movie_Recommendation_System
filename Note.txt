pd.values
pd.value_count
pd.info()
pd.isnull().sum() - if any null values, if yes then sum all null values
pd.dropna - Remove all rows with NULL values from the DataFrame.
pd.duplicated().sum() - if any duplicated values, if yes then sum all duplicated values
pd.apply() - apply to all
In pandas : lamda - accepts a function as an argument and applies that function to all the elements in the Series.
The fit(data) method is used to compute the mean and std dev for a given feature to be used further for scaling.
The transform(data) method is used to perform scaling using mean and std dev calculated using the .fit() method.
The fit_transform() method does both fits and transform.
Sparse matrix -  matrix which has most of the elements zero is called sparse matrix
euclidean distance is not good - as the Dimensions increases the value is not properly outputed,  therefore we use cosine_similarity
for cosine_similarity distance is inversely proportional to similarity
